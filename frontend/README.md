# React Frontend

This folder contains a simple React app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It communicates with a Laravel backend via REST API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Install dependencies with `npm install`

## Development server

```
npm run dev
```

The app expects the backend API base URL to be set with the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable. If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api`.

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```

## Preview production build

```
npm run preview
```
